These are typically located in areas with high geothermal activity, such as California, Nevada, and Hawaii.\n\n2. For direct use of geothermal heat, we're talking about things like heating buildings, growing greenhouse plants, or bathing in hot springs. This kind of use is more widespread across the country, but there might be certain states where it's particularly common.\n\nSo, your next steps could be:\n\n- Research which states have the most geothermal electricity generation.\n- Look into which states make the most use of direct geothermal heat.\n- Consider whether some states might be high in both categories.\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to find out where geothermal energy is used, but to understand why and how it's used there.
