Let's break it down together:\n\n1. First, let's think about the term \"pearl\". Pearls are not found in seas per se, but they are produced by certain mollusks (like oysters) that live in seas. These mollusks create pearls as a response to an irritant inside their shell, like a grain of sand.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the location. The question asks about pearls found in India. However, it's important to note that while India has seas, it's not typically known for its pearl production. This doesn't mean it's impossible, but it might make our search a bit more challenging.\n\n3. Next, we should consider what kind of mollusk could produce such pearls. The most common types of mollusks that produce pearls are oysters and freshwater mussels. \n\n4. Finally, we need to think about the conditions these mollusks need to live in. Different types of mollusks prefer different environments - some prefer cold water, others warm; some live in shallow waters, others in deep seas.\n\nSo, now you have a better understanding of what to look for and where to look. You can start researching the types of mollusks found in Indian seas, their living conditions, and whether they are known to produce pearls. This should lead you closer to the answer."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.
