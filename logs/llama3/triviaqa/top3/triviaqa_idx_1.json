'Five Nine': This passage refers to a film titled \"Five Ninety\" and does not contain any relevant mathematical information.\n\nRelevance:\nThe given passages are not directly relevant to the question, as they do not discuss or provide context about the fraction five ninths (5/9). The closest related concept is found in the 'Fifths of Seven' passage, which explains fractions but focuses on 5/7 instead of 5/9.\n\nAnswer:\nTo find the answer to the question \"Five ninths of three fifths is a?\", we need to perform a calculation using the given fractions. First, convert 5/9 to decimal form (0.5555...) and then multiply it by 3/5 (which equals 0.6). The result is approximately 0.3333, which can be converted back to a fraction: 1/3. So, five ninths of three fifths is equal to one third."}], "self_rerank": [{"role": "user", "content": "Complete the following task:\n        \nThe questions that need to be answered are: \nFive ninths of three fifths is a?\nTo answer these questions, I retrieved some passages.\nPassages: \n['Five nines\\n', 'Fifths of Seven\\n', 'Five Nine\\n']\n\nBased on the content of the questions to be answered, Please label each passage with two tags and give the reason, the first one is whether it is useful or not, and the second one is whether it is relevant or not,\nThe four possible scenarios are as follows:\n1.<useful><relevant>, 2.<useless><relevant>, 3.<useful><irrelevant>, 4.<useless><irrelevant>.\nGeneration Format:\n1. passage:..., label:..., reason:...\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. passage: 'Five nines\\n', label: <useless><irrelevant>, reason: This passage is not useful because it does not provide any information about fractions or calculations.
