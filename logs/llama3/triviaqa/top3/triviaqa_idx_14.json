The title of the film, 'Cry Freedom', suggests that it is likely about a figure who fought for freedom or civil rights.\n2.

One such figure is Steve Biko, a notable anti-apartheid activist who died in 1977. His life and death fit the time frame and theme of 'Cry Freedom'.\n5.

If you haven't seen the film, you might know someone who has, or there might be resources available online or in a library that can provide a synopsis or review of the film.\n\n2. **Understand the context**: The film is from 1987, a time when South Africa was under international scrutiny for its policy of apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination. This context can help us guess who the film might be about.\n\n3. **Look for key words**: The question asks about a 'South African civil rights leader'. This is a crucial clue. There were many individuals who fought against apartheid and advocated for civil rights in South Africa. But which one is connected to 'Cry Freedom'?\n\n4. **Narrow down the possibilities**: Given your understanding of the film and the context, try to think of a few key figures from the anti-apartheid movement. Remember, the person should be someone whose life could be depicted in a biographical drama.\n\n5. **Check for corroboration**: Once you have a name (or a few names), see if you can find any supporting evidence that connects this person to 'Cry Freedom'. This could be in the form of other reviews, articles, or even interviews with the film's creators.\n\nRemember, the goal is not just to know the answer, but to understand how to arrive at the answer.
