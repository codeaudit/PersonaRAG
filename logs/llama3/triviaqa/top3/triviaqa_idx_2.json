It's a type of fermented liquid condiment that originated in the city of Worcester in Worcestershire, England. The exact recipe is a secret, but it's known to contain ingredients like vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, garlic, tamarind extract, and anchovies.\n\nSo, the question asks about the type of fish used in its production. From the list of ingredients, we can see that anchovies are used. Anchovies are small, silvery fish that are often used in Mediterranean and Asian cuisines for their strong flavor. They are typically sold dried or preserved in oil or salt.\n\nNow, let's think about why anchovies might be used in Worcestershire sauce. One reason could be their strong flavor, which can add depth and complexity to the sauce. Additionally, anchovies are a good source of natural glutamates, which are compounds that enhance the savory taste of food. This could help to balance out the sweet and sour flavors in the sauce.\n\nFinally, let's consider whether there might be other types of fish used in Worcestershire sauce. While anchovies are the only type of fish explicitly listed as an ingredient, it's possible that other types of fish could be used in small amounts as part of the fermentation process or as a component of other ingredients (like tamarind extract). However, without more information about the specific manufacturing process, it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, we can conclude that anchovies are the type of fish used in the production of Worcestershire sauce. There may be other types of fish present in small amounts, but this would require further investigation into the specific manufacturing process."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n[\"BULLET::::- Worcestershire sauce a fermented liquid condiment made with anchovy, it's primarily used to flavor meat or fish dishes.
