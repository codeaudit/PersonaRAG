He won the 1958 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Major Pollock in \"Separate Tables\", his only nomination for an Oscar. Appearing on-screen for only 23 minutes in the film, this was the briefest performance ever to win a Best Actor Oscar, until Anthony Hopkins' award for his appearance in the 1991 film \"The Silence of the Lambs\", which is a little over 16 minutes. He was also a co-host of the 30th, 31st, and 46th Academy Awards ceremonies. After Niven had won the Academy Award, Goldwyn called with an invitation to his home. In Goldwyn's drawing room, Niven noticed a picture of himself in uniform which he had sent to Goldwyn from Britain during the Second World War. In happier times with Goldwyn, he had observed this same picture sitting on Goldwyn's piano. Now years later, the picture was still in exactly the same spot. As he was looking at the picture, Goldwyn's wife Frances said, \"Sam never took it down.\"\n"], "global_memory": "", "__answers__": ["Separate Tables", "SEPARATE TABLES", "Separate tables", "separate tables", "separate tables play", "Separate Tables (play)"]}}
