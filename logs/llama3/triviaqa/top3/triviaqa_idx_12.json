This already significantly narrows down our search.\n\n3. **Identify Shared Characteristics**: All three presenters have worked together on several projects in the past. This means they likely hosted a show together, which is what we're looking for. \n\n4. **Research**: Now, we need to research shows that were aired on Channel 4 and had these three presenters. A good place to start could be the internet or library resources. \n\n5. **Analyze the Results**: Once we have some potential answers, we need to analyze them to see which one fits all the criteria. \n\nRemember, it's important to approach this methodically and systematically.
