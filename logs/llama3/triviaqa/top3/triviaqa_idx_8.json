Russia is a federal state composed of 85 federal subjects, 24 of which are called republics. These republics have their own president and constitution, and they often represent areas where non-Russian ethnic groups live.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the name given in the question: Grozny. It's a city, but it's also a capital. So, we need to find out which republic has Grozny as its capital.\n\n3. To do this, you might already know or could look up that Grozny is a significant city in the North Caucasus region of Russia. This region is home to several republics.\n\n4. So, our task now is to identify which of these republics has Grozny as its capital.
