First, let's define what we mean by an \"avenue.\" In a general sense, an avenue is a wide street, typically in a city, that provides access to a number of different locations.\n\n2. The Arc de Triomphe is a famous monument in Paris, France, located at the end of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, another well-known avenue. \n\n3. Around the Arc de Triomphe, there are several roads that meet at this location, often in a circular pattern. The question asks for the number of \"avenues\" that radiate from the Arc de Triomphe. \n\n4. To answer this question, we would need to identify which of the roads or paths radiating from the Arc de Triomphe are considered avenues. \n\n5. This might require some knowledge about the specific names and classifications of these roads in Paris. For example, you could look up the names of the streets that intersect with the Arc de Triomphe and then check if any of them are officially classified as avenues.\n\n6. Remember, the term \"radiate\" implies that we're looking for roads that originate from or extend outwards from the Arc de Triomphe, rather than simply passing by it.\n\nSo, the next step would be to research the specific names of the streets that intersect with the Arc de Triomphe and then determine if any of them are officially classified as avenues."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Arc de Triomphe\\n', \"The avenue begins at the Place Charles de Gaulle and ends in a junction with Avenue de Malakoff and Boulevard Pereire.
