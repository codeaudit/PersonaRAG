Here's a plan that takes into account user preferences, immediate needs, and global insights to adjust search queries and prioritize results:\n\n1. **Query Expansion**: Utilize query expansion techniques with related terms like 'solo artists', 'UK number 1 singles', 'music history', 'release dates', and 'chart performances' to capture more relevant documents in the search space. For example, the query \"first solo UK number 1 single\" can be expanded to \"first solo UK number 1 singles in music history with release dates and chart performances.\"\n\n2. **Prioritize Relevant Documents**: Based on user interests, prioritize documents related to music (specifically solo artists and their hits), geological formations, and natural disasters. This can be achieved by refining ranking algorithms using historical user preferences, immediate needs, and session behavior. For instance, since the user is interested in the first solo UK number 1 single of a specific artist, prioritize documents that directly answer this query or are closely related to it.\n\n3. **Leverage User Preferences**: Since the user has shown interest in music-related content, ensure that the Contextual Retrieval Agent delivers more relevant and valuable results by focusing on documents about solo artists and their hits, music history, and chart performances. This can be done by incorporating user preferences into the ranking algorithm, giving higher scores to documents that align with the user's interests.\n\n4. **Session-Specific Behaviors**: Analyze the user's interaction with previous results and session duration to identify patterns in their search behavior. Since the user has spent 30 minutes on the current session and clicked on documents about music-related content, it can be inferred that they are highly engaged with this topic.

This can help identify trends, popular topics, or emerging artists that users may be interested in.\n\n6. **Feedback loops**: Implement feedback loops to continuously update and refine agents' models based on user feedback and preferences. For example, use collected implicit and explicit feedback to adjust ranking algorithms, query expansion terms, and recommended content for individual users. This will help ensure more personalized and relevant results over time.\n\n7. **User segmentation**: Segment users based on their interests, search query history, session behavior, and feedback patterns.
