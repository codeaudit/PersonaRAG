One way could be to look up the credits for the song 'It Doesn't Matter Anymore'. This information is often available on music platforms, in the liner notes of physical album releases, or through a simple internet search.\n\n4.

So, your next step would be to look up the credits for 'It Doesn't Matter Anymore' to confirm who the songwriter is.
