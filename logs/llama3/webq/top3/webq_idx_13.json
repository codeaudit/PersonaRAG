It has a population of around 56,000 people, mostly Inuit (also known as Kalaallit).\n\n**Step 2: Historical Background**\nIn the past, Greenland was a Danish colony. Yes, you read that correctly - Denmark had control over Greenland from the 18th century until 1953.\n\n**Step 3: Current Political Status**\nNow, let's fast-forward to the present day. In 1953, Greenland became a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, but with a special status. It gained home rule in 1979, which means that Greenland has a significant degree of autonomy from Denmark.\n\nHere's where things get interesting...\n\n**Step 4: The Question**\nSo, which country does Greenland belong to? Well, this is where we need to think carefully about the meaning of \"belong to.\" Does it mean being an independent country, or can it also refer to a territory with a special status within another country?\n\nTake your time, think about these questions, and see if you can come up with some possible answers.
