To determine the type of drugs she used, I'll rely on publicly available information and reports from credible sources.\n\nAccording to various news outlets and biographies, Whitney Houston's struggles with drug addiction began in the 1980s. She was known to have abused cocaine, marijuana, and prescription medications, including opioids and benzodiazepines.\n\nIn 2004, Houston's husband at the time, Bobby Brown, revealed that she had used drugs such as crack cocaine and marijuana regularly. Additionally, her autopsy report following her death in 2012 listed cocaine as a contributing factor to her accidental drowning in a bathtub.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nWhitney Houston was known to have abused various drugs, including:\n\n1. Cocaine (crack and powder)\n2. Marijuana\n3. Prescription opioids (e.g., hydrocodone, oxycodone)\n4. Benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax, Valium)\n\nIt's essential to note that drug addiction is a serious issue that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or celebrity status. Whitney Houston's struggles with drug abuse serve as a reminder of the importance of seeking help and support for addiction."}], "user_profile": [{"role": "user", "content": "Your task is to help the User Profile Agent improve its understanding of user preferences based on ranked document lists and the shared global memory pool.\n\nQuestion:\nwhat type of drugs did whitney houston?\nPassages:\n['BULLET::::- Whitney Houston, singer, from alcohol, alprazolam, diphenhydramine, cocaine, and cyclobenzaprine\\n', 'Various sources document Thaw\\'s drug use, which became habitual after his expulsion from Harvard.
