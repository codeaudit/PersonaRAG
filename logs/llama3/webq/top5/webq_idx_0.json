Our goal is to identify TV shows that are shot in New York. To tackle this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nBefore we begin, let's make sure we understand what the question is asking. We need to find TV shows that have a significant portion of their production taking place in New York. This could include shows that film on location in New York City or surrounding areas, or those that have a production studio based in the state.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm Categories**\nTo get started, let's think about different categories of TV shows that might be shot in New York. Some possible categories could be:\n\n* Sitcoms (e.g., comedies set in NYC apartments)\n* Dramas (e.g., crime dramas or medical shows set in NYC hospitals)\n* Reality TV shows (e.g., competition shows or documentaries filmed on location in NYC)\n* News programs (e.g., news broadcasts originating from NYC studios)\n\n**Step 3: Research and Identify Shows**\nNow, let's start researching specific TV shows that fit into these categories. We can use online resources such as IMDb, Wikipedia, or entertainment news websites to find information about TV shows and their production locations.\n\nFor example, we could start by looking up popular sitcoms set in NYC, like \"Friends\" or \"Seinfeld.\" Do they film on location in NYC or have a production studio based there?\n\nAs we research, let's make a list of potential TV shows that meet our criteria. We can also consider asking ourselves questions like:\n\n* Are there any TV shows that are specifically set in NYC or use the city as a central character?\n* Are there any production studios or filming locations in NYC that are commonly used by multiple TV shows?\n\n**Step 4: Verify Information and Refine Our List**\nOnce we have a list of potential TV shows, let's verify the information to ensure they are indeed shot in New York. We can cross-check our research with reputable sources to confirm production locations.\n\nAs we refine our list, we may need to eliminate some shows that don't meet our criteria or add new ones that we discover through further research.\n\nNow it's your turn!
