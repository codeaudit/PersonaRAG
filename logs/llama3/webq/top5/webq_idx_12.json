For instance, if a user searches for \"best NFL games,\" the Document Ranking Agent can prioritize documents containing awards or accolades related to NFL games.\n\n**3. Personalized Ranking:** \nIntegrate historical user preferences and search behavior to create personalized ranking models. For example, if a user frequently searches for NFL Network schedules, the agent should prioritize documents containing relevant information about upcoming games or schedules.\n\n**4. Contextual Search Suggestion Refining:** \nAnalyze the user's search query and context to provide refined suggestions. In this case, the Document Ranking Agent can suggest related queries like \"NFL schedule 2023\" or \"Thursday Night Football schedule.\"\n\n**5. Relevance Scoring:** \nDevelop a relevance scoring system that considers factors such as:\n\t* Entity recognition: How closely do the entities mentioned in the passage match the user's search query?\n\t* User preferences: Does the document align with the user's historical interests and search behavior?\n\t* Session behavior: Is the document relevant to the user's current search session?\n\n**6. Query Expansion and Filtering:** \nExpand the user's search query to include related terms and filter out irrelevant documents. For instance, if the user searches for \"NFL Network games this year,\" the agent can expand the query to include terms like \"2023 NFL schedule\" or \"Thursday Night Football 2023.\"\n\n**7. Real-time Updates:** \nIntegrate real-time updates from trusted sources, such as NFL Network's official website or social media channels, to ensure that the Document Ranking Agent provides the most up-to-date information.\n\n**8. New Query Recommendations:** \nBased on the user's search behavior and preferences, suggest new queries that might be of interest.
