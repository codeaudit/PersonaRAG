However, to further enhance the response based on user interests, we can provide additional context on why Spain did not receive any states after the war.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Spain did not actively participate in the conflict on the side of the American colonies. While Spain did provide some support to the American cause, such as supplies and military assistance, they did not have any territorial claims or interests in the outcome of the war. Therefore, no states were returned to Spain as a result of the Revolutionary War.\n\nBy incorporating this additional context into the response, we can provide a more comprehensive answer that aligns with the user's interest in historical events and political contexts.

The Revolutionary War refers to the war fought by the American colonies against British rule in the late 18th century. During this time, Spain was also involved in the conflict as an ally of the American colonies against the British.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, there were several territories that changed hands between the European powers involved in the conflict. One of these territories was Florida, which was originally under Spanish control but was temporarily transferred to British control during the war.\n\nNow, let's think about which state was returned to Spain after the Revolutionary War. To answer this question, we need to consider the territories that were under Spanish control before the war and were returned to Spain after the conflict ended.\n\nI would recommend looking into the specific territories that Spain controlled in North America before and after the Revolutionary War to determine which state was returned to Spain. This will involve researching the historical events and treaties that took place during this time period.\n\nRemember to consider the context of the Revolutionary War and the alliances and conflicts between the European powers involved in the conflict. By carefully analyzing the historical events and territories involved, you will be able to determine which state was returned to Spain after the Revolutionary War."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['In 1974 the dictatorship of the \"Estado Novo\" was brought to an end by a military \"coup\" known as the Carnation Revolution.
