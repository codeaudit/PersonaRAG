Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness.

Mycenae was a significant ancient Greek city known for its role in the Trojan War and its powerful rulers, such as Agamemnon. It was later captured by the Dorians, a group of people who invaded Greece around the 12th century BC.\n\nNow, let's consider who could have helped recapture Mycenae once they were old enough to fight. One important figure to consider is the legendary hero Heracles. Heracles was known for his incredible strength and bravery, and he played a significant role in many Greek myths and stories.\n\nNext, let's think about the timeline. Heracles was a contemporary of the Trojan War, which took place around the 12th century BC. This would align with the timeframe of the Dorians capturing Mycenae.\n\nBased on this information, it is possible that Heracles could have been the one who helped recapture Mycenae once those who were old enough to fight were ready. His strength and heroism would have made him a formidable ally in reclaiming the city.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the context of Mycenae, the involvement of Heracles, and the timeline of events, it is likely that Heracles played a role in helping recapture Mycenae once those who were old enough to fight were ready."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n[\"Around 510 BC the Alcmaeonidae family, who had been exiled from Athens, requested that Sparta help them overthrow Hippias, the son of Pisistratus and tyrant of Athens.
