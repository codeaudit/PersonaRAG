The pH scale is a scale that measures the acidity or basicity of a solution. It ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being the most basic.\n\nTo determine the highest base on the pH scale, we need to understand that bases have pH values greater than 7. So, we are looking for the highest pH value on the scale.\n\nNext, we need to identify the substances that are considered bases. Bases are substances that can accept protons or donate hydroxide ions (OH-) in a solution. Some common examples of bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\nNow, let's think about the pH values of these bases. Since the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, the highest base on the pH scale would have a pH value closest to 14.\n\nBased on this information, can you determine which base has the highest pH value on the pH scale?
