Aluminum wiring was commonly used in homes in the 1960s and 1970s due to its cost-effectiveness compared to copper wiring. However, it was later discovered that aluminum wiring posed a fire hazard due to its tendency to expand and contract with temperature changes, leading to loose connections and potential overheating.\n\nStep 2: Next, discuss the safety concerns associated with aluminum wiring. The Canadian Electrical Code (CEC) and the Electrical Safety Authority (ESA) have recognized the potential risks of aluminum wiring and have issued guidelines for its use. These guidelines recommend regular inspections and maintenance to ensure the safety of aluminum wiring installations.\n\nStep 3: Now, explain the timeline of when aluminum wiring stopped being used in Ontario. In the late 1970s, the use of aluminum wiring in residential construction began to decline as the safety concerns became more widely known. By the early 1980s, copper wiring had become the preferred choice for new residential construction in Ontario.\n\nStep 4: Lastly, mention that while aluminum wiring is no longer commonly used in new construction, there are still many homes in Ontario that have aluminum wiring installed. It is important for homeowners with aluminum wiring to be aware of the potential risks and to take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of their electrical systems."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Also in April 2007, Duncan announced that Ontario would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012.
