The Geysers in California is the largest geothermal field in the world and has been producing electricity since the 1960s. Therefore, it can be inferred that California is the state where geothermal energy is utilized the most in the US."}], "vanilla_chatgpt": [{"role": "user", "content": "Please provide concise answers to the questions.

We are looking for where geothermal energy is used the most in the US. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider a few key factors. Geothermal energy is primarily used for electricity generation and direct use applications such as heating and cooling. \n\nOne way to determine where geothermal energy is used the most is to look at the states with the highest geothermal energy capacity. The states with the highest geothermal capacity are typically the ones where geothermal energy is used the most. \n\nAnother factor to consider is the presence of geothermal power plants in different states. Geothermal power plants generate electricity using geothermal energy and can give us an idea of where geothermal energy is being utilized the most.\n\nAdditionally, we can look at the geothermal resources available in different states. States with high geothermal potential are more likely to use geothermal energy extensively.\n\nBy considering these factors and analyzing data on geothermal capacity, geothermal power plants, and geothermal resources in different states, we can determine where geothermal energy is used the most in the US. Let's start by researching these factors and comparing the data from different states."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Geothermal energy in the United States\\n', 'U.S. Geothermal\\n', \"Geothermal power is power generated via the collection of thermal energy, stored over millions of years in the earth's core.
