Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was written during the French Revolution in 1789. It was a fundamental document that outlined the rights of individuals and the limits of government power.\n\n2. To determine who wrote the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, we need to consider the historical context of the French Revolution and the key figures involved in drafting the document.\n\n3. One important figure to consider is the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat and military officer who played a significant role in the early stages of the French Revolution. Lafayette was a proponent of constitutional monarchy and was involved in drafting the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\n4. Another key figure to consider is the Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s, a clergyman and political theorist who also played a role in drafting the Declaration. Siey\u00e8s was known for his influential pamphlet \"What is the Third Estate?\" which argued for the rights of the common people.\n\n5. Additionally, the Declaration was influenced by Enlightenment thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu, who advocated for individual rights and the separation of powers.\n\n6. By considering the historical context and the key figures involved in the French Revolution, we can begin to narrow down our search for the author or authors of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nI hope this analysis helps guide you in finding the answer to the question.
