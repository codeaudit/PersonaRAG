The input that tells the computer which task to execute is typically in the form of a command or instruction. This command is given to the computer through a program or software.\n\n2. When a user interacts with a computer, they provide input through various devices such as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. This input is then processed by the computer's operating system and software programs.\n\n3. The input that tells the computer which task to execute is usually in the form of a specific command or function. For example, if a user wants to open a file, they may input a command such as \"open file.txt\" into a command line interface or click on a specific icon in a graphical user interface.\n\n4. The computer then interprets this input and executes the corresponding task. This process involves the computer following a series of instructions to complete the desired action.\n\n5.
