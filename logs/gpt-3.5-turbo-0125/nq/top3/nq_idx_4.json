These early Polynesian settlers are believed to have arrived in Hawaii around 1,500 years ago.\n\nNext, we need to consider the arrival of Western explorers and settlers to Hawaii. The first recorded contact between Hawaii and the Western world was in 1778 when British explorer Captain James Cook landed on the islands. This marked the beginning of increased contact between Hawaii and the Western world.\n\nAs Hawaii became more known to the Western world, immigrants from various countries started arriving on the islands. The first significant wave of immigrants to Hawaii came in the early to mid-19th century when laborers from China, Japan, Portugal, and other countries were brought to work on sugar plantations.\n\nSo, to answer the question of when the first immigrants came to Hawaii, we need to consider both the arrival of the original Polynesian settlers around 1,500 years ago and the arrival of Western explorers and immigrant laborers in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nI hope this analysis helps you understand the timeline of immigration to Hawaii.
