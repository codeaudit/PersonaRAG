The Revolutionary War refers to the war fought by the American colonies against British rule from 1775 to 1783. During this time, Spain was also involved in the war as an ally of the American colonies against the British.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, there were several territories that changed hands or were returned to their original owners. In this case, we are looking for a state that was returned to Spain after the war.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to think about the territories that were under Spanish control during the Revolutionary War. One key territory that was returned to Spain after the war was Florida. Florida had been under Spanish control before being transferred to British control in 1763 as part of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years' War. However, Spain regained control of Florida as part of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War in 1783.\n\nTherefore, the state that was returned to Spain after the Revolutionary War was Florida."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['In 1974 the dictatorship of the \"Estado Novo\" was brought to an end by a military \"coup\" known as the Carnation Revolution.
