We are looking for where geothermal energy is used the most in the US. \n\nTo answer this question, we need to consider a few factors. Firstly, we should think about the geographical locations in the US where geothermal energy resources are most abundant. Geothermal energy is typically more accessible in regions with active tectonic plate boundaries, such as the western United States.\n\nNext, we should consider the states that have invested in geothermal energy infrastructure and have a higher capacity for geothermal energy production. States like California, Nevada, and Hawaii are known for their geothermal energy projects and utilization.\n\nAdditionally, we should think about the energy policies and incentives in place in different states that promote the development and use of geothermal energy. States with supportive policies and incentives are likely to have a higher usage of geothermal energy.\n\nLastly, we should also consider the overall energy consumption and demand in different states. States with higher energy demands may be more inclined to use geothermal energy as a renewable and sustainable energy source.\n\nBy considering these factors and analyzing the data on geothermal energy production and usage in different states, we can determine where geothermal energy is used the most in the US."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Geothermal energy in the United States\\n', 'U.S. Geothermal\\n', \"Geothermal power is power generated via the collection of thermal energy, stored over millions of years in the earth's core.
