Hawaii is a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, so it is not connected to any other landmass. This means that people who came to Hawaii would have had to travel across the ocean to get there. \n\nNext, let's consider the history of Hawaii. Hawaii was originally settled by Polynesians who arrived in canoes from other Pacific islands. These Polynesian settlers are believed to have arrived in Hawaii sometime between 300 and 600 AD. They were skilled navigators who traveled long distances across the ocean using only the stars, currents, and other natural signs to guide them. \n\nAfter the Polynesians settled in Hawaii, there were no further significant waves of immigration until the late 18th century when European explorers and traders began to visit the islands. The first recorded arrival of Europeans in Hawaii was in 1778 when British explorer Captain James Cook landed on the island of Kauai. \n\nSo, to answer the question of when the first immigrants came to Hawaii, we need to consider the arrival of the Polynesians sometime between 300 and 600 AD and the arrival of Europeans in 1778.
