Aluminum wiring was commonly used in homes in the 1960s and 1970s.\n2. However, it was discovered that aluminum wiring posed a fire hazard due to its tendency to overheat and corrode.\n3. As a result, the use of aluminum wiring in homes was phased out in favor of copper wiring, which is safer and more reliable.\n4. The exact date when they stopped using aluminum wiring in Ontario may vary, but it is generally accepted that it was discontinued in the late 1970s or early 1980s.\n\nAnswer:\nThey stopped using aluminum wiring in Ontario in the late 1970s or early 1980s.\nUser Insights from Interaction Analysis: \nConsolidated Global Message Pool:\n\n1.

Aluminum wiring was commonly used in the 1960s and 1970s as a cheaper alternative to copper wiring. However, over time, it was discovered that aluminum wiring posed a higher risk of fire hazards due to its tendency to expand and contract with temperature changes, leading to loose connections and potential overheating.\n\nNext, it's important to consider the regulations and standards in Ontario regarding the use of aluminum wiring. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were changes made to the Ontario Electrical Safety Code (OESC) to address the safety concerns associated with aluminum wiring. These changes included stricter installation requirements and recommendations for regular maintenance and inspections of aluminum wiring systems.\n\nIt's also important to note that while the use of aluminum wiring was phased out in new construction projects, existing buildings with aluminum wiring may still be in use today. This is why it's crucial for homeowners and building owners to be aware of the potential risks associated with aluminum wiring and take necessary precautions to ensure safety.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of aluminum wiring in Ontario was phased out in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to safety concerns. However, existing buildings with aluminum wiring may still be in use today, highlighting the importance of regular maintenance and inspections to prevent fire hazards."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Also in April 2007, Duncan announced that Ontario would ban the sale of inefficient incandescent light bulbs by 2012.
