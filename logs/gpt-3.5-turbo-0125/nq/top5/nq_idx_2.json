The movie is set in the mid-1800s and follows the story of a man who seeks solace in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nNext, we need to consider the filming locations that were used to bring the story to life. Filmmakers often choose locations that closely resemble the setting of the story to create a more authentic and immersive experience for viewers.\n\nTo find out where \"Jeremiah Johnson\" was filmed, we can start by researching information about the production of the movie.
