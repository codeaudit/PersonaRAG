This is because malachite is a green mineral commonly found in copper deposits, and copper is a metal that is often extracted from ores such as malachite. Therefore, the correct answer is copper.\n\nRefined Response:\nMalachite is an ore of copper. This is due to the fact that malachite, a green mineral commonly found in copper deposits, is a source from which copper, a metal, is extracted.

First, let's understand what an ore is. An ore is a naturally occurring rock or mineral that contains a valuable substance, typically a metal.\n\n2. Malachite is a green mineral that is often used as a gemstone or for ornamental purposes. It is also an ore of a certain metal.\n\n3. To determine which metal malachite is an ore of, we need to consider the chemical composition of malachite. Malachite is composed of copper carbonate hydroxide (Cu2CO3(OH)2).\n\n4. Based on the chemical composition of malachite, we can conclude that malachite is an ore of copper.

For the first time Jane Austen gives over the narrator's authority to a character almost completely, In \"Emma\", many events and situations are seen from Emma's point of view, but the central intelligence lies somewhere between the narrator and the reader, who together see that Emma sees wrongly.
