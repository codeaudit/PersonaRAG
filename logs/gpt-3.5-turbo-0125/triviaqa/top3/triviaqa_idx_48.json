The reason for this contradiction is that Anne Elliot is the central intelligence of the novel. Sir Walter is seen as Anne sees him, with resigned contempt. For the first time Jane Austen gives over the narrator's authority to a character almost completely, In \"Emma\", many events and situations are seen from Emma's point of view, but the central intelligence lies somewhere between the narrator and the reader, who together see that Emma sees wrongly. In \"Persuasion\", Anne Elliot's feelings and evaluations correspond to those of the narrator in almost every situation, although there are several significant lapses ... It seems that this transfer of authority placed a strain on Jane Austen's accustomed narrative tendencies and that she could not maintain it completely.\n", "Elizabeth Bennet is the protagonist in the 1813 novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen.
