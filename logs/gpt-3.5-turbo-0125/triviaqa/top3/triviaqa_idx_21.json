A census is a survey conducted by a government to collect information about the population, including demographic data such as age, gender, and occupation.\n\nNext, we need to consider how often a census is typically conducted. In the UK, a census is usually conducted every 10 years. This means that we can start by looking at the most recent years that are multiples of 10.\n\nNow, let's think about the most recent census years in the UK. The previous census was conducted in 2011, so the next census would have been conducted 10 years later. By adding 10 years to 2011, we can calculate the year of the most recent census in the UK.\n\nI encourage you to take a moment to calculate the year of the most recent census in the UK based on the information provided.
