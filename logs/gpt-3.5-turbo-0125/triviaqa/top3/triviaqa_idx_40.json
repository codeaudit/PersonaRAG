The question is asking us to identify the composer of four different songs: \"Night and Day\", \"I Get a Kick out of You\", \"Well, Did You Evah!\", and \"I've Got You Under My Skin\".\n\n2. To solve this question, we need to think about composers who are known for writing these popular songs. It's important to remember that different composers have different styles and genres they are known for.\n\n3. One way to approach this problem is to think about composers who are famous for writing classic American standards or popular music from the mid-20th century. These songs are often associated with the Great American Songbook.\n\n4. It might also be helpful to consider the time period when these songs were popular and who were the prominent composers during that era.\n\n5. By considering these factors and doing some research on composers who are known for writing these specific songs, we can narrow down our options and identify the composer who wrote \"Night and Day\", \"I Get a Kick out of You\", \"Well, Did You Evah!\", and \"I've Got You Under My Skin\".\n\nI hope this analysis helps guide you in the right direction to solve the question.

The reason for this contradiction is that Anne Elliot is the central intelligence of the novel. Sir Walter is seen as Anne sees him, with resigned contempt. For the first time Jane Austen gives over the narrator's authority to a character almost completely, In \"Emma\", many events and situations are seen from Emma's point of view, but the central intelligence lies somewhere between the narrator and the reader, who together see that Emma sees wrongly. In \"Persuasion\", Anne Elliot's feelings and evaluations correspond to those of the narrator in almost every situation, although there are several significant lapses ... It seems that this transfer of authority placed a strain on Jane Austen's accustomed narrative tendencies and that she could not maintain it completely.\n", "Elizabeth Bennet is the protagonist in the 1813 novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" by Jane Austen.
