In golf, \"par\" is the number of strokes a skilled golfer is expected to take to complete a hole. For example, a par 3 hole means that a skilled golfer should take 3 strokes to complete the hole.\n\nNow, an Albatross in golf refers to a score that is better than an eagle. An eagle is when a golfer completes a hole in two strokes under par. So, an Albatross is even better than that.\n\nTo determine how many strokes under par an Albatross is for a given hole, we need to consider the par of the hole and subtract the number of strokes it took to complete the hole in an Albatross.\n\nFor example, if a hole is a par 5 and a golfer completes it in 3 strokes, that would be considered an Albatross. To calculate how many strokes under par that is, we would subtract 3 (the number of strokes taken) from 5 (the par of the hole).\n\nI hope this analysis helps you understand how to determine the number of strokes under par for an Albatross in golf.
