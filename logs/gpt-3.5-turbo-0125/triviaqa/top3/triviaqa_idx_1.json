It is asking for five ninths of three fifths. \n\nStep 1: Find the product of three fifths. To do this, multiply the numerator (3) by the numerator (5) to get 15. Then multiply the denominator (5) by the denominator (1) to get 5. So, three fifths is equal to 15/5.\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find five ninths of 15/5. To do this, multiply the numerator (15) by the numerator (5) to get 75. Then multiply the denominator (5) by the denominator (9) to get 45. So, five ninths of three fifths is equal to 75/45.\n\nStep 3: Simplify the fraction 75/45 if possible.
