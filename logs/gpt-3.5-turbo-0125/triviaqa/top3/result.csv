Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan's shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. ""Go to fighting or get away!"", Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple.

Averaging 7–10\xa0km above datum (Martian ""sea"" level), Tharsis contains the highest elevations on the planet and the largest known volcanoes in the Solar System. Three enormous volcanoes, Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Arsia Mons (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes), sit aligned NE-SW along the crest of the bulge. The vast Alba Mons (formerly Alba Patera) occupies the northern part of the region. The huge shield volcano Olympus Mons lies off the main bulge, at the western edge of the province.

If you would like to explore more about Tintern Abbey and its connection to Wordsworth's poetry, as well as its historical and cultural importance, feel free to ask for further information.",True,Tintern Abbey stands on the River Wye.,True,"First, let's break down the question. We are asked about the location of Tintern Abbey, which is famous for being mentioned in Wordsworth's poetry. The question specifically asks about the river on which Tintern Abbey stands.

To answer this question, we need to think about the geography of Tintern Abbey. Tintern Abbey is located in Wales, near the border with England. It is situated in the Wye Valley, which is known for its picturesque landscapes and the River Wye that flows through it.

Now, let's focus on the river mentioned in the question. The River Wye is a significant river in Wales and England, known for its beauty and the role it plays in the landscape of the Wye Valley. Tintern Abbey is indeed located on the banks of the River Wye, adding to its charm and historical significance.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that Tintern Abbey stands on the River Wye.",True,Tintern Abbey stands on the banks of the River Wye.,True,"Reading Notes:
- William Wordsworth's poem ""Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey"" is often linked with the Abbey, although it does not mention the ruins directly.
- The Abbey was considered impressive but imperfectly Picturesque before Wordsworth's poem immortalized it.
- The Duke of Beaufort attempted to restore the Abbey in the 18th century, but his efforts did more harm than good.
- Despite criticisms from some like Gilpin, most tourists considered Tintern Abbey to be the most important and beautiful location on the Wye Tour.
- Wordsworth's poem ""Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey"" was written on July 13, 1798.

Relevance:
The passages provide information about the history and significance of Tintern Abbey, as well as its association with William Wordsworth's poetry. The passages mention Wordsworth's poem ""Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey"" and the impact it had on the perception of the Abbey. Additionally, the passages discuss the restoration efforts by the Duke of Beaufort and the general admiration of tourists for Tintern Abbey.

Answer:
Tintern Abbey stands on the River Wye.",True,"1. passage: William Wordsworth's poem ""Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey, on revisiting the banks of the Wye during a tour, July 13, 1798"", is often linked with the Abbey, although it does not actually mention the ruins. Instead, it recalls an earlier visit five years before and comments on the beneficial internalisation of that memory. Following a similar walking tour with friends, Robert Bloomfield also dedicated a long poem to “The Banks of the Wye” (1811) in which the Abbey is only mentioned briefly as one of many items on the way. However, that was followed in 1825 by yet another long poem dealing with the area, annotated and in four books, by Edward Collins: ""Tintern Abbey or the Beauties of Piercefield"" (1825)., label: <useful><relevant>, reason: This passage provides information about the connection between Tintern Abbey and famous poets like Wordsworth, which directly relates to the question about the Abbey's significance.
2. passage: At the end of the first day of the Tour, the travellers would arrive at the town of Monmouth, and spend the night in an inn. The following morning, tourists would pass riverside hamlets and Picturesque natural scenery before finally arriving at the Tour's greatest spectacle, Tintern Abbey. There, awestruck seekers of the Picturesque observed the bare columns and walls of what was once a massive structure, overrun with vegetation and decay. Before the Abbey was immortalised by William Wordsworth's poem ""Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey..."" it was considered to be an impressive, although imperfectly Picturesque, ruin. During the 18th century, the Abbey was purchased by the Duke of Beaufort, who had immediately attempted to “restore” the Abbey. The Duke's restorative efforts, which included hammering bronze letters into the brick floor, introducing plants that compromised the structural integrity of arches and hallways, and other such harmful practices, ultimately did more damage than good to the ruins. Despite the Duke's restorative efforts, Gilpin remained unimpressed with the Abbey, and complained that “though the parts are beautiful, the whole is ill-shaped”. Most tourists, however, generally considered Tintern Abbey to be the most important and beautiful location on the Wye Tour. Later tourists were probably familiar with Wordsworth's famous poem ""Lines.."" and the importance of that piece only increased the aura of the Abbey., label: <useful><relevant>, reason: This passage provides historical context and details about Tintern Abbey, including its significance to tourists and the impact of Wordsworth's poem, directly relevant to the question about the Abbey's location.
