First, let's identify the key information in the question. The film in question is 'Cry Freedom,' which was released in 1987. The film is a biographical drama, which means it is based on the life of a real person. We are asked to identify the South African civil rights leader that the film is about.

Next, let's think about prominent South African civil rights leaders during that time period. One of the most well-known figures in the fight against apartheid in South Africa was Nelson Mandela. However, it's important to remember that 'Cry Freedom' is a biographical drama, so the film is likely about a different civil rights leader.

To narrow down our options, we can think about other influential figures in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. One name that comes to mind is Steve Biko, who was a prominent anti-apartheid activist and leader of the Black Consciousness Movement.

Considering the context of the film being a biographical drama about a South African civil rights leader, it is highly likely that the film 'Cry Freedom' is about Steve Biko.

4. passage: 'The premise of ""Cry Freedom"" is based on the true story of Steve Biko, the charismatic South African Black Consciousness Movement leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of Apartheid; and Donald Woods, the liberal white editor of the ""Daily Dispatch"" newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the Black People\'s Convention working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student\'s Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognised under the Apartheid regime. Biko\'s political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973. The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko\'s death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance. As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organisations, especially those closely associated with Biko. The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa. After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life, Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government. Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: ""Biko"", exposing police complicity in his death.

5. passage: 'One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was Niccolò Machiavelli's ""The Prince"", written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ""The Discourses"", a rigorous analysis of classical antiquity, did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including Jean-Jacques Rousseau) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence. Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the Republic of Florence rather than the oligarchy of the di Medici family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a pragmatic and somewhat consequentialist view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power. Thomas Hobbes, well known for his theory of the social contract, goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the English Renaissance. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual.

1. Wordsworth's poetry made Tintern Abbey famous.
2. Tintern Abbey is located near a river.
3. The river mentioned in Wordsworth's poetry is likely the river near Tintern Abbey.

Answer:
The river near Tintern Abbey is the River Wye.",True,"Tintern Abbey, made famous by Wordsworth's poetry, stands on the River Wye. This river is mentioned in Wordsworth's poetry and is located near Tintern Abbey, adding to the picturesque setting that inspired his work. The River Wye flows near the abbey, enhancing its natural beauty and historical significance.",True,Tintern Abbey stands on the River Wye.,True,"First, let's break down the question. The question is asking about the location of Tintern Abbey, which is famous for being mentioned in Wordsworth's poetry. To answer this question, we need to identify the river on which Tintern Abbey stands.

Next, let's think about the context of Tintern Abbey. Tintern Abbey is a historic abbey located in Wales. It is known for its picturesque setting and its significance in literature, particularly in Wordsworth's poetry.

Now, let's consider the geography of Wales. Wales is known for its beautiful landscapes, including rivers. To determine the river on which Tintern Abbey stands, we need to think about the rivers in Wales that are near the abbey.

One important clue to consider is the mention of Tintern Abbey in Wordsworth's poetry. Wordsworth was a Romantic poet who often wrote about nature and the beauty of the natural world. This suggests that the river on which Tintern Abbey stands is likely to be a significant natural feature that inspired Wordsworth's poetry.

Based on this information, we can start to narrow down our options and think about which river in Wales is most likely to be associated with Tintern Abbey. Remember to consider the context of the question and the clues provided to guide you to the correct answer.",False,Tintern Abbey stands on the River Wye.,True,"Reading Notes:
- William Wordsworth's poem ""Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey"" is often linked with the Abbey, although it does not mention the ruins directly.
- The Abbey was considered impressive but imperfectly Picturesque before Wordsworth's poem immortalized it.
- The Duke of Beaufort attempted to restore the Abbey in the 18th century, but his efforts did more harm than good.
- Most tourists considered Tintern Abbey to be the most important and beautiful location on the Wye Tour.
- Wordsworth's poem ""Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey"" was written after a walking tour with his sister in the Welsh Borders.

Answer:
Tintern Abbey stands on the River Wye.",True,"1. passage: 'William Wordsworth's poem ""Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey, on revisiting the banks of the Wye during a tour, July 13, 1798"", is often linked with the Abbey, although it does not actually mention the ruins. Instead, it recalls an earlier visit five years before and comments on the beneficial internalisation of that memory. Following a similar walking tour with friends, Robert Bloomfield also dedicated a long poem to “The Banks of the Wye” (1811) in which the Abbey is only mentioned briefly as one of many items on the way. However, that was followed in 1825 by yet another long poem dealing with the area, annotated and in four books, by Edward Collins: ""Tintern Abbey or the Beauties of Piercefield"" (1825).', label: <useful><relevant>, reason: This passage provides information about the connection between Tintern Abbey and William Wordsworth's poem, which is directly relevant to the question about the Abbey.

The following morning, tourists would pass riverside hamlets and Picturesque natural scenery before finally arriving at the Tour's greatest spectacle, Tintern Abbey. There, awestruck seekers of the Picturesque observed the bare columns and walls of what was once a massive structure, overrun with vegetation and decay. Before the Abbey was immortalised by William Wordsworth's poem """"Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey..."""" it was considered to be an impressive, although imperfectly Picturesque, ruin. During the 18th century, the Abbey was purchased by the Duke of Beaufort, who had immediately attempted to “restore” the Abbey. The Duke's restorative efforts, which included hammering bronze letters into the brick floor, introducing plants that compromised the structural integrity of arches and hallways, and other such harmful practices, ultimately did more damage than good to the ruins. Despite the Duke's restorative efforts, Gilpin remained unimpressed with the Abbey, and complained that “though the parts are beautiful, the whole is ill-shaped”. Most tourists, however, generally considered Tintern Abbey to be the most important and beautiful location on the Wye Tour. Later tourists were probably familiar with Wordsworth's famous poem """"Lines.."""" and the importance of that piece only increased the aura of the Abbey.', label: <useful><relevant>, reason: This passage provides historical and descriptive information about Tintern Abbey, which is directly relevant to the question about the Abbey's location.

It was written by Wordsworth after a walking tour with his sister in this section of the Welsh Borders. The description of his encounters with the countryside on the banks of the River Wye grows into an outline of his general philosophy.
