In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the Black People\\'s Convention working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student\\'s Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognised under the Apartheid regime. Biko\\'s political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973. The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody.

We are asked to identify the South African civil rights leader that the film is about.\n\nNext, let's think about prominent South African civil rights leaders during that time period. One of the most well-known figures in the fight against apartheid in South Africa was Nelson Mandela. However, it's important to remember that 'Cry Freedom' is a biographical drama, so the film is likely about a different civil rights leader.\n\nTo narrow down our options, we can think about other influential figures in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. One name that comes to mind is Steve Biko, who was a prominent anti-apartheid activist and leader of the Black Consciousness Movement.\n\nConsidering the context of the film being a biographical drama about a South African civil rights leader, it is highly likely that the film 'Cry Freedom' is about Steve Biko.\n\nSo, based on our analysis, the South African civil rights leader featured in the 1987 film 'Cry Freedom' is most likely Steve Biko."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Cry Freedom is a 1987 British-South African epic drama film directed by Richard Attenborough, set in late-1970s apartheid era South Africa.

In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the Black People\\'s Convention working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student\\'s Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognised under the Apartheid regime. Biko\\'s political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973. The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko\\'s death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance. As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organisations, especially those closely associated with Biko. The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa. After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life, Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government. Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: \"Biko\", exposing police complicity in his death. That book, along with Woods\\'s autobiography \"Asking For Trouble\", both being published in the UK, became the basis for the film.\\n', label: <useful><relevant>, reason: This passage provides detailed information about the real-life events involving Steve Biko and Donald Woods, which is directly relevant to the questions to be answered.\n5. passage: 'BULLET::::- 2 May \u2013 BBC2 airs \"Cry Freedom\", Richard Attenborough\\'s acclaimed film about South African journalist Donald Woods.\\n', label: <useful><irrelevant>, reason: This passage mentions the airing of the film 'Cry Freedom' on BBC2 but does not directly provide information relevant to the questions about the South African civil rights leader depicted in the film."}], "question_info": {"question": "How many avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe?", "passages": ["Arc de Triomphe\n", "The avenue begins at the Place Charles de Gaulle and ends in a junction with Avenue de Malakoff and Boulevard Pereire.
