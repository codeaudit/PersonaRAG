The 2014 FIFA World Cup is a major international soccer tournament that is held every four years. In order to determine which country will host the 2014 World Cup, we need to think about the process of selecting a host country for such a significant event.\n\nOne key factor to consider is the bidding process that FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, uses to select the host country for the World Cup. Countries interested in hosting the tournament submit bids to FIFA, outlining their plans for hosting the event, including proposed venues, infrastructure, and accommodations.\n\nNext, FIFA evaluates the bids based on various criteria, such as the country's ability to host a large-scale sporting event, the quality of the proposed venues, and the country's soccer infrastructure. After careful consideration, FIFA ultimately selects a host country for the World Cup.\n\nTo determine which country will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, we need to research the bidding process for that particular tournament. By examining the bids submitted by various countries and the criteria used by FIFA to evaluate those bids, we can identify the host country for the 2014 World Cup.\n\nI encourage you to research the bidding process for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and consider the factors that FIFA typically takes into account when selecting a host country.
