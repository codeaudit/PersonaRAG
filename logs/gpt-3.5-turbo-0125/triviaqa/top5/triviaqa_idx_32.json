Wales is known for its beautiful landscapes, including rivers. To determine the river on which Tintern Abbey stands, we need to think about the rivers in Wales that are near the abbey.\n\nOne important clue to consider is the mention of Tintern Abbey in Wordsworth's poetry. Wordsworth was a Romantic poet who often wrote about nature and the beauty of the natural world.

Instead, it recalls an earlier visit five years before and comments on the beneficial internalisation of that memory. Following a similar walking tour with friends, Robert Bloomfield also dedicated a long poem to \u201cThe Banks of the Wye\u201d (1811) in which the Abbey is only mentioned briefly as one of many items on the way.

The following morning, tourists would pass riverside hamlets and Picturesque natural scenery before finally arriving at the Tour's greatest spectacle, Tintern Abbey. There, awestruck seekers of the Picturesque observed the bare columns and walls of what was once a massive structure, overrun with vegetation and decay. Before the Abbey was immortalised by William Wordsworth's poem \"\"Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey...\"\" it was considered to be an impressive, although imperfectly Picturesque, ruin. During the 18th century, the Abbey was purchased by the Duke of Beaufort, who had immediately attempted to \u201crestore\u201d the Abbey. The Duke's restorative efforts, which included hammering bronze letters into the brick floor, introducing plants that compromised the structural integrity of arches and hallways, and other such harmful practices, ultimately did more damage than good to the ruins. Despite the Duke's restorative efforts, Gilpin remained unimpressed with the Abbey, and complained that \u201cthough the parts are beautiful, the whole is ill-shaped\u201d. Most tourists, however, generally considered Tintern Abbey to be the most important and beautiful location on the Wye Tour. Later tourists were probably familiar with Wordsworth's famous poem \"\"Lines..\"\" and the importance of that piece only increased the aura of the Abbey.', label: <useful><relevant>, reason: This passage provides historical and descriptive information about Tintern Abbey, which is directly relevant to the question about the Abbey's location.\n3. passage: 'BULLET::::- 13 July \u2013 William Wordsworth's poem \"Lines composed a few miles above Tintern Abbey on revisiting the banks of the Wye during a tour, 13 July 1798\" is written.', label: <useful><irrelevant>, reason: This passage provides specific information about the date when Wordsworth's poem was written, which is not directly relevant to the question about the location of Tintern Abbey.\n4. passage: 'Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey is a poem by William Wordsworth.
