In August 2001, friends of Billy organized the \"Thrash of the Titans\" benefit concert, featuring seminal Bay Area thrash bands Vio-lence, Death Angel, Exodus, Heathen, and others. The show was headlined by a Legacy reunion, featuring Steve Souza on vocals, and former guitarist Alex Skolnick, who had not played with the band since 1992, and Greg Christian. Late in 2001, Testament released \"First Strike Still Deadly\", a collection of re-recordings (with modern studio technology) of songs from their first two albums.
