Next, let's identify the country in question, which is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a socialist state that existed from 1922 to 1991, encompassing Russia and several other countries in Eastern Europe and Asia.\n\n3. Now, we need to determine who was the first leader of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was established in 1922, so we need to look for a leader who came into power around that time.\n\n4. One key figure who comes to mind is Vladimir Lenin. Lenin was a prominent Bolshevik revolutionary who played a crucial role in the Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government and the establishment of a socialist state in Russia.\n\n5.
