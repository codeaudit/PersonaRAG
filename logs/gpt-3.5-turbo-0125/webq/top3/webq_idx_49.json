The show was headlined by a Legacy reunion, featuring Steve Souza on vocals, and former guitarist Alex Skolnick, who had not played with the band since 1992, and Greg Christian. Late in 2001, Testament released \"First Strike Still Deadly\", a collection of re-recordings (with modern studio technology) of songs from their first two albums.
