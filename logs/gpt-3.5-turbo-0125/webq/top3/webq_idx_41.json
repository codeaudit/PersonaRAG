In August 2001, friends of Billy organized the \"Thrash of the Titans\" benefit concert, featuring seminal Bay Area thrash bands Vio-lence, Death Angel, Exodus, Heathen, and others. The show was headlined by a Legacy reunion, featuring Steve Souza on vocals, and former guitarist Alex Skolnick, who had not played with the band since 1992, and Greg Christian. Late in 2001, Testament released \"First Strike Still Deadly\", a collection of re-recordings (with modern studio technology) of songs from their first two albums. The album featured the lineup of Billy, Peterson, Di Giorgio, the return of Alex Skolnick on guitar, and John Tempesta on drums.\n", "Patsy Swayze suffered a stroke in September 2013.
