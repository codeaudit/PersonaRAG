He is best known for his work in the field of mathematics and his life was depicted in the movie \"A Beautiful Mind\".\n\nNext, let's focus on the question at hand - which college did John Nash teach at? To answer this question, we need to consider the timeline of John Nash's academic career. John Nash received his Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1950. After completing his studies, he went on to teach at various institutions.\n\nOne key institution where John Nash taught was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He held a position as a faculty member at MIT in the 1950s. However, it is important to note that John Nash also taught at other universities during his career.\n\nIn order to determine the specific college where John Nash taught, we need to consider additional information such as the time period during which he was teaching and any notable institutions where he held a teaching position.
