Prior to 1991, Russia was part of the Soviet Union and used the Soviet ruble as its currency. However, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia introduced the Russian ruble as its official currency in 1992.\n\nNext, we need to consider any major changes or events that may have affected Russia's currency in 2012. It's important to note that the Russian ruble has remained the official currency of Russia since its introduction in 1992. However, there have been fluctuations in the value of the ruble due to various economic and political factors.\n\nIn 2012, Russia was experiencing economic growth and stability, which would suggest that the Russian ruble continued to be the country's currency during that time. It's also worth mentioning that the Russian Central Bank is responsible for regulating the country's currency and ensuring its stability.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical context and economic conditions of Russia in 2012, we can conclude that the country most likely continued to use the Russian ruble as its currency during that year."}], "vanilla_rag": [{"role": "user", "content": "Passages: \n['Ukrainians mostly live in the east (Transnistria) and the north, while Russians mostly live in urban areas: 27% of all Russians live in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, 18% live in Tiraspol, 11% in Bender and 6% in B\u0103l\u0163i.
