The territory of modern-day Russia has been inhabited by various ethnic groups for thousands of years. \n\nOne key factor to consider is the Slavic migration into Eastern Europe, which is believed to have occurred around the 6th century AD. The Slavs are considered to be the ancestors of modern-day Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. \n\nAdditionally, the Varangians, a group of Scandinavian warriors and traders, played a significant role in the early history of Russia. They established the Kievan Rus' state in the 9th century, which laid the foundation for the Russian nation. \n\nFurthermore, the Mongol invasion of the 13th century had a lasting impact on the development of Russia. The Mongols ruled over the region for several centuries, influencing the culture, politics, and society of the Russian people. \n\nOverall, the origins of the Russian people are a result of a complex interplay of Slavic, Scandinavian, and Mongol influences over the centuries.
