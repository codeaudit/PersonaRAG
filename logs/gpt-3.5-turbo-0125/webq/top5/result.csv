First, let's define what a dictator is. A dictator is a ruler who has complete control over a country and its government, often ruling with absolute power and authority. 

Next, let's identify the time period and location mentioned in the question - the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a socialist state that existed from 1922 to 1991 in Eurasia. 

Now, let's think about the early leaders of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was established after the Russian Revolution of 1917, which led to the overthrow of the Tsarist autocracy and the establishment of a communist government. 

One of the key figures in the early years of the Soviet Union was Vladimir Lenin, who was the leader of the Bolshevik Party and played a crucial role in the Russian Revolution. However, Lenin can't be considered a dictator as he died in 1924, just a few years after the establishment of the Soviet Union.

After Lenin's death, a power struggle ensued among the top leaders of the Communist Party. Eventually, Joseph Stalin emerged as the leader of the Soviet Union and ruled as a dictator from the late 1920s until his death in 1953.
