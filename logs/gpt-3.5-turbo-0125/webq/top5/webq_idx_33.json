One significant event during Taft's presidency was the passage of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act in 1909, which was a controversial tariff that led to a split in the Republican Party. Taft also continued the trust-busting efforts of his predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, by filing more antitrust suits than any previous president. \n\nAdditionally, Taft's administration focused on promoting foreign trade and expanding American influence abroad, particularly in Latin America and Asia. He also supported the establishment of the Department of Labor and the Children's Bureau, which focused on improving labor conditions and protecting the rights of children. \n\nLastly, Taft is also known for his role in the progressive movement and his efforts to reform the judicial system.
