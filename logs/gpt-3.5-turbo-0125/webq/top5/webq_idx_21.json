He conducted experiments with electricity and invented the lightning rod as a result. He also coined terms such as \"positive\" and \"negative\" to describe the charge of electricity.\n\n4. In addition to these inventions, Franklin also created the glass armonica, an instrument made of glass bowls that produce musical tones when rubbed with wet fingers.
